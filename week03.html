    <h1>Week 03 report</h1>
    <h2>What did I do since the last meeting?</h2>
    <p>I was able to read the assigned chapters (8, 12, 15).</p>
    <p>I was not able to get together with my team due to timezone constraints, we were able to interact through slack and completed the assignments for this week.</p>
    <h2>What am I going to do next?</h2>
    <p>I will complete the reading tomorrow and jump to the team assignment.</p>
    <h2>What are my blockers?</h2>
    <p>None</p>

    <p>I used javascript before but I thought that it was just used for linear programming, I did not know it was possible to create and manage objects.</p>
    <p>I have to be careful with creating an array with the array constructor using just one element, in javascript, this is interpreted as the size, so, we would have unexpected behaviours.</p>
    <p>I like ES6 notation for classes, it is much more familiar for those writing code in another language.</p>
    <p>Objects can morph at runtime using the prototype property.</p>
    <p>Monkey patching ("Extending" built in classes with new functionality) seems to be a very powerfull tool, it is a shame that it is not recommended in JS</p>
    <p>Property descriptors (New object methods introduced in JavaScript ES5) is a new concept for me</p>
    <p>When creating objects from objects, intance of won't work, isPrototypeOf should be used instead</p>
    <p>Borrowing methods from prototypes is an interesting concept. JS is very flexible</p>
    <p>Modules seems to be more effective than libraries, when the latter is just a collection of functions</p>
    <p>React and Vue.js are very popular libraries to build more modular UI</p>
    <p>I have used NodeJS and NPM before for implementing Models and controllers in a very simple and controlled way.</p>
