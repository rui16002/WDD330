    <h1>Week 03 report</h1>
    <h2>What did I do since the last meeting?</h2>
    <p>I was able to read the assigned chapters (5, 6, 7).</p>
    <p>I was not able to get together with my team due to timezone constraints, we were able to interact through slack and completed the assignments for this week.</p>
    <h2>What am I going to do next?</h2>
    <p>I will complete the reading tomorrow and jump to the team assignment.</p>
    <h2>What are my blockers?</h2>
    <p>None</p>

  <div class="findings">
    <p>Patterns and regular expressions are great to validate inputs before sending to services</p>
    <p>Inputs should be validated on both ends as they can be manipulated on client side</p>
    <p>JSON format is like XML but simpler</p>
    <p>DOM (Document object Model) represents the HTML. It could be accessed and manipulated through JS </p>
    <p>Event listeners help us to react to different user events (actions) and manipulate the page content/behaviour accordingly</p>
    <p>Event handlers are defined inline in the HTML, EG: on a button onclick property: onclick="function" </p>
    <p>Event listeners are defined in js files or tags, EG: document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);</p>
    <p>There are several types of events, EG: On click, onblur, onload, mouseup, mousedown, mouseover, keyup, keydown</p>
    <p>preventdefault function stops default behaviour from happening EG: information being sent to the service on submit a form</p>
