    <h1>Week 05 report</h1>
    <h2>What did I do since the last meeting?</h2>
     <p>I was able to read the assigned chapter (10).</p>
     <p>I was able to better collaborate with my team despite timezone constraints, we were able to interact through slack and completed the assignments for this week.</p>
     <p>This chapter's topic has been particularly relevant for me since I work as a QA Engineer</p>
    <h2>What am I going to do next?</h2>
     <p>I will complete the reading between today and tomorrow and jump to the team assignment.</p>
     <p>I will also start working on the ToDo assignment due on week06</p>
    <h2>What are my blockers?</h2>
     <p>None</p>

    <h1>Findings</h1>
    <p>I agree with the following statement about error handling: "Failing silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to track down." I work as a QA engineer and is often diffiult to report a defect that is meaningful and easy to solve if I can collect enough evidence and/or details about it.</p>
    <p>I also agree with the following statement: "but it’s much better to spot errors early on, rather than have them cause problems later" it is important to use >> 'use strict'; << at the beginning of a JS fileto get alerts of sloppy coding practices.</p>
    <p>As with other languages we have to be extremely careful of assigning a value instead of comparing, a = b instead of a === b</p>
    <p>I have used the console to triage some defects before, and I have found it very useful. Debugger; could also be useful but as mentioned in the readding it could be dangerous if left in production code.</p>
    <p>Jest in a JS testing framework for TDD created by Facebook widely used nowadays. I like its syntax, it is very human readable and intuitive. I also find interesting the way TDD is applied in the example given, this way a robust code could be written.</p>
