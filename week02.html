    <h1>Week 02 report</h1>
    
    <h2>What did I do since the last meeting?</h2>
     <p>I was able to sign up to get the lectures I need for the semester.</p>
     <p>I was able to read and review chapter 2 to 4 and reported my findings to the instructor.</p>
     <p>I was not able to get together with my team due to timezone constraints, we were able to interact through slack and completed the assignments for this week.</p>
     
    <h2>What am I going to do next?</h2>     
     <p>Next week I will try to organize better the my schedule so I can be a more effective contributor to the team.</p>

    <h2>What are my blockers?</h2>
     <p>My main blocker is an external factor that will not cause much more trouble at least for another month.</p>
