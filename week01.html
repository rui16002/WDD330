    <h1>Week 01 report</h1>
    <h2>What did I do since the last meeting?</h2>
     <p>I completed the readings except the video on sitepoint, I was not able to sign up to sitepoint, my order was canceled, I will repeat the order next week.</p>
     <p>I was able to create the portfolio https://github.com/rui16002/WDD330 but for now the repository is empty.</p>
     <p>I reviewed javascript from here: https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp? (Links to an external site.)</p>
    <h2>What am I going to do next?</h2> 
     <p>I don't think signing up for sitepoint would be a problem next week, I have to sign up through BYU bookstore, and I did not do it properly this week, I have been given the correct instructions to do so.</p>
     <h2>What are my blockers?</h2>
     <p>Access to SitePoint</p>
