    <h1>Week 11 report</h1>
    <h2>What did I do since the last meeting?</h2>
     <p>I dedicated most of the time on the project to be delivered on the final week, I lost most of my code, and I had to redo several parts to catch up. None of the 3 minigames is still working, I will try to make work at least two of them, the animal soundboard and the bubble pop game</p>
     <p>I was able to complete the team's assignment although I didn't interact with the team</p>
    <h2>What am I going to do next?</h2>
     <p>I will focus on the final project, I will need to refactor most of it to make it more efficient and using OOP</p>
    <h2>What are my blockers?</h2>
     <p>None</p>
