    <h1>Final Report</h1>
    <h2>What did I do since the last meeting?</h2>
     <p>I dedicated all the time on the project to be delivered on the final week, I was able to reproduce the code I lost and spend quite some time on fixing a bug on dragging elements for mobiles.
     It turned out I was using the wrong library (The same library had 2 different repositories)</p>
    <h2>What am I going to do next?</h2>
     <p>I will prepare myself for the next semester</p>
    <h2>What are my blockers?</h2>
     <p>None</p>

    <h1>Findings</h1>
    <p>I learned a lot during this semester. I learned that JS is much more powerful than I thought. There is the OOP that I didn't know JS supported. The use of JS on client and server side, Node JS, SVG and how powerful it is. There are plenty of libraries to manipulate HTML. I learned a lot on CSS transformations</p>
    <p>Here is a link on a short video of my son using the minigames I created for my final project</p>
