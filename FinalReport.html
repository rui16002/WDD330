    <h1>Final Report</h1>
    <h2>What did I do since the last meeting?</h2>
     <p>I dedicated all the time on the project to be delivered on the final week, I was able to reproduce the code I lost and spend quite some time on fixing a bug on dragging elements for mobiles.
     It turned out I was using the wrong library (The same library had 2 different repositories)</p>
    <h2>What am I going to do next?</h2>
     <p>I will prepare myself for the next semester</p>
    <h2>What are my blockers?</h2>
     <p>None</p>

    <h1>Findings</h1>
    <p>I learned a lot during this semester. I learned that JS is much more powerful than I thought.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is the OOP that I didn't know JS supported.</li>
      <li>The use of JS on client and server side, Node JS</li>
      <li>SVG and how powerful it is.</li>
      <li>There are plenty of JS libraries to manipulate HTML.</li>
      <li>I learned a lot on CSS transformations and animations</li>
      <li>The use of JSON files</li>
      <li>HTML5 new tags such as audio, custom tags, form validation tags</li>
      <li>The importance of clearing cache between tests</li>
      <li>One important thing I was able to practice is the usage of a git repository.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although I learned a lot about debugging, I still lack experience on this matter. It took me several days to figure out that I was using the wrong library and as a result I spend several hours trying to debug my code to figure out what was wrong in my code.</p>
    <p>Here is a link on a short video of my son using the minigames I created for my final project</p>
